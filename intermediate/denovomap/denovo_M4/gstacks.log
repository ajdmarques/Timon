Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 197 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  1 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.5%);
  For the remaining 196 loci (99.5%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 181.8 bp;
  190 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (96.9%)
    Mean overlap: 30.7bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 181.6;
  Out of 1644 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 8.4 reads per locus),
    1644 were successfuly aligned (100.0%);
  Mean insert length was 172.4, stdev: 37.4 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 196 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=4.5x, stdev=0.3x, min=4.2x, max=5.0x
  mean number of sites per locus: 181.5
  a consistent phasing was found for 1 of out 1 (100.0%) diploid loci needing phasing
