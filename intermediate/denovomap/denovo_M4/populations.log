Parsing population map...
The population map contained 3 samples, 1 population(s), 1 group(s).
Working on 3 samples.
Working on 1 population(s):
    Timon: GVA1418, GVA1515, GVA1926
Working on 1 group(s) of populations:
    defaultgrp: Timon

Raw haplotypes will be written to './intermediate/denovomap/denovo_M4/populations.haplotypes.tsv'

Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './intermediate/denovomap/denovo_M4/populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 198 loci.
Kept 198 loci, composed of 35920 sites; 0 of those sites were filtered, 7 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 198.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 171.41bp (stderr 2.82);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 192.00 (97.0%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 177.67bp (stderr 2.42); mean overlap: 30.67bp (stderr 0.18);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 181.11bp (stderr 2.75).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  Timon: 1.4286 samples per locus; pi: 0.85714; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 35860/7/7; private alleles: 0
