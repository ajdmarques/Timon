Parsing population map...
The population map contained 3 samples, 1 population(s), 1 group(s).
Working on 3 samples.

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 195 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 196 loci.
Kept 1 loci, composed of 148 sites; 0 of those sites were filtered, 0 variant sites remained.
Number of loci with PE contig: 1.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of loci: 138.00bp (stderr inf);
Number of loci with SE/PE overlap: 1.00 (100.0%);
  Mean length of overlapping loci: 148.00bp (stderr -nan); mean overlap: 31.00bp (stderr -nan);
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 148.00bp (stderr -nan).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
  Timon: -nan samples per locus; pi: -nan; all/variant/polymorphic sites: 148/0/0; private alleles: 0
Aborted. (basic_string::substr: __pos (which is 1) > this->size() (which is 0))
