# STACKS Tutorial

The following is a tutorial for using the STACKS workflow. Trial data for this workflow uses 10000 randomly selected RADSeq reads from three Timon specimens. The scripts are run in R. Additional programs, STACKS and Trimmomatic, and called from the R environment. The R script is intended to generate the necessary input and output files/directories with each run. Existing output directories are removed during each run to avoid duplicating results and accumulating storage space. 

Access the workflow by opening any chapter in "./_book/*.html"
